            <!-- Global Statistics and Tips -->
            <h3>Food System and Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
            <p>The food system is responsible for more than <strong>â…“ of global greenhouse emissions</strong>, with a majority coming from animal-based foods. Industrial agriculture contributes to large land use and deforestation. Consider adopting a plant-based diet to reduce environmental impact.</p>

            <h3>Waste Production</h3>
            <p>The total generation of municipal solid waste in the U.S. was <strong>292.4 million tons</strong>, or about <strong>4.9 pounds per person per day</strong>.</p>
            <p>The average U.S. consumer throws away <strong>81.5 lbs of clothes every year</strong>, contributing significantly to textile waste.</p>

            <h3>Energy Usage</h3>
            <p>The average American household uses about <strong>10,500 kilowatt hours of electricity</strong> annually, which accounts for a substantial portion of household energy consumption.</p>

            <h3>Transportation Emissions</h3>
            <p>A typical passenger vehicle emits about <strong>4.6 metric tons of CO2</strong> per year. Switching to electric vehicles or using public transport can help reduce this footprint.</p>

            <h3>The Corporate Issue</h3>
            <p>While individual actions are important, over <strong>70% of global carbon emissions</strong> come from just 100 major companies. Corporate responsibility and systemic changes are key to tackling climate change.</p>
            
            <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
            <p>Advocate for corporate responsibility, support climate policies, and adopt sustainable practices in your own life to make a meaningful impact.</p>
