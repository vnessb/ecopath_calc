            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>The food system is responsible for more than ⅓ of global greenhouse emissions, a majority being from animal-based foods. 
            Industrial agriculture uses a large amount of fossil fuels in factories, food processing, and transport and is also responsible 
            for large land use and deforestation. Food waste is also an environmental problem, with the US alone producing 170 million 
            metric tons of CO2 emissions annually.</p>
            <p>Plant-based diets have shown to be beneficial for the environment as they require fewer natural resources to produce compared 
            to diets with meat while also being advantageous for individual health.</p>

    <!-- Clothing/Consumption Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Clothing/Consumption</h2>
            <p>Fast fashion is a major contributor to the world’s waste production. Fast fashion retailers turn out new clothes every two weeks 
            in high quantities to keep up with the trends and cut costs. Whatever goes unsold is wasted and dumped in landfills. A huge input 
            of energy and water is needed to keep textile factories running, producing even more waste and pollution.</p>
            <p>Initiatives to make the clothing production process more sustainable have been put in place to minimize waste, pollution, and 
            energy usage. Sustainable fashion brands have turned to using more eco-friendly, plant-based materials such as pineapple leaves, 
            cork, and mushrooms as a substitute for animal-based materials. Though sustainable fashion has become an environmentally friendly 
            alternative to fast fashion, it is not very cost-friendly for many. An affordable option is buying secondhand clothing.</p>

     <!-- Energy Usage Section -->   
        <section>
            <h2>Energy Usage</h2>
            <p>Approximately 40% of the world’s annual energy consumption is due to buildings because of lighting, heating, cooling, and air conditioning. 
            The average American household uses about 10,500 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, mainly used for air conditioning and powering refrigerators.</p>
            <p>Energy usage has resulted in major environmental concerns such as acid precipitation, the production of volatile organic compounds, 
            and chlorides, which can cause the acidification of lakes and damage to aquatic life. It has also contributed to the depletion of the 
            stratospheric ozone layer, which can lead to more exposure to damaging ultraviolet radiation, and generation of CO2 and greenhouse gasses.</p>
            <p>Efforts to reduce energy consumption are being made in order to lessen these environmental impacts through the use of renewable energy.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>Traffic emissions have played a big part in climate change. The transportation industry is responsible for approximately 50% of global oil consumption, producing 25% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions. In an effort to reduce carbon emissions, alternative transportation methods are encouraged such as public transportation, carpooling, and electric vehicles.</p>

     <!-- Waste Production Section -->   
        <section>
            <h2>Waste Production</h2>
            <p>The waste sector is responsible for 3.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to about 20% of global methane emissions. In the US alone, food waste produces approximately 170 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. Waste incineration, once intended as an alternative to landfills, is now creating additional environmental challenges. Many waste incinerators in the US are aging, and extending their use generates excess emissions, contributing significantly to air pollution. In fact, waste incineration in the US produces 11.8 million metric tons of CO2 annually.</p>
